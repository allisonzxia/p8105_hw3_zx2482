  as_tibble()
```

``` r
brfss_overall_health =
  brfss_smart2010 |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") |> 
  filter(response  %in% c("Excellent","Very good","Good","Fair","Poor")) |> 
  arrange(desc(response)) |> 
  mutate(response = ordered(response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good","Very good","Excellent"))) |> 
  arrange(response) 
```
