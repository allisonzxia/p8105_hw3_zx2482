## Problem 2

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010") 

brfss_smart2010 = 
  brfss_smart2010 |> 
  as_tibble()
```

``` r
brfss_overall_health =
  brfss_smart2010 |> 
  rename(state = Locationabbr,
         location = Locationdesc) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") |> 
  filter(response  %in% c("Excellent","Very good","Good","Fair","Poor")) |> 
  arrange(desc(response)) |> 
  mutate(response = ordered(response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good","Very good","Excellent"))) |> 
  arrange(response) 
```

#### Answer questions about the data

- In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
  in 2010?

``` r
states_2002 <- 
  brfss_overall_health |> 
  filter(year == "2002") |> 
  group_by(state) |> 
    summarize(number_locations = n()) |> 
  filter(number_locations >= 7) |> 
  pull(state)
states_2010 <- 
  brfss_overall_health |> 
  filter(year == "2010") |> 
  group_by(state) |> 
    summarize(number_locations = n()) |> 
  filter(number_locations >= 7) |> 
  pull(state)
```

In 2002, these following states were observed at 7 or more locations:
AZ, CO, CT, DE, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, IN, KS, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO,
NC, NE, NH, NJ, NV, NY, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VT, WA.
In 2010, these following states were observed at 7 or more locations:
AL, AR, AZ, CA, CO, CT, DE, FL, GA, HI, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, LA, MA, MD,
ME, MI, MN, MO, MS, MT, NC, ND, NE, NH, NJ, NM, NV, NY, OH, OK, OR, PA,
RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VT, WA, WY

- Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
  contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data_value
  across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this
  average value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a
  line for each state across years – the geom_line geometry and group
  aesthetic will help).

``` r
brfss_excellent = 
  brfss_overall_health |> 
  filter(response == "Excellent") |> 
  group_by(state, year) |> 
  summarize (mean_data_value = mean(data_value, na.rm=TRUE))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'state'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
ggplot(brfss_excellent, aes(x=year, y=mean_data_value, color=state)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title="Spaghetti Plot",
       x="Year",
       y="Mean Data Value") +
  theme_minimal()
```

- Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
  distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
  locations in NY State.

``` r
brfss_NY_responses = 
  brfss_overall_health |> 
  filter(state == "NY" & (year =="2006" | year == "2010"))
```
