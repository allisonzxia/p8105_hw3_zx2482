library(tidyverse)
library(ggridges)
library(patchwork)

library(p8105.datasets)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
	echo = TRUE,
	warning = FALSE,
	fig.width = 8, 
  fig.height = 6,
  out.width = "90%"
)
```

## Problem 2
```{r Load data}
data("brfss_smart2010") 

brfss_smart2010 = 
  brfss_smart2010 |> 
  as_tibble()
```

```{r clean brfss_smart2010}
brfss_overall_health =
  brfss_smart2010 |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") |> 
  filter(response  %in% c("Excellent","Very good","Good","Fair","Poor")) |> 
  arrange(desc(response)) |> 
  mutate(response = ordered(response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good","Very good","Excellent"))) |> 
  arrange(response) 
```
